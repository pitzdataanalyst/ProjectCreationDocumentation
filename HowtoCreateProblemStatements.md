# ✅ Step 4: From Data to Problem Statements — How to Do It
## 🔧 Start with Your Raw Data Columns
Let’s say your dataset has these columns:

Date | Time | Product | Category | Quantity | Price | Total_Amount | Customer_ID

These give you clues about what kind of questions you can ask.

#### 🔍 Look at What Each Column Tells You
Date/Time → Time-based trends (daily/monthly/peak hours)

Product/Category → Product performance

Quantity/Price/Total_Amount → Revenue & profitability

Customer_ID → Customer behavior & loyalty

#

# 🧠 Now Create Sample Problem Statements
These are mini business problems you might discover by analyzing the data:

📈 “Analyze daily and monthly sales trends to identify peak revenue periods and potential low-performing days.”

☕ “Identify the most profitable items and their contribution to total revenue.”

🕒 “Determine peak customer hours to optimize staffing and inventory.”

🎯 “Understand customer preferences by analyzing repeat purchase behavior and average spend.”

🧾 “Find operational inefficiencies such as overstocking or unsold products.”

#### You don’t need all of these — pick the ones your dataset can support.

# 🧪 Example Workflow to Create Problem Statements
#### ✅ Step-by-step:
## * Explore the Data

    * Use Pivot Tables or Power BI visuals

    * Check which products are sold most

    * Look at revenue by date/time

## * Notice Patterns

    * Latte is sold most between 8–10 AM

    * Sunday has the highest sales

    * Combo sales increase average order value

## * Convert Observations to Problems

    “Latte is the highest-selling product” →
      Problem Statement: “Identify products driving morning revenue.”

    “Sunday has highest sales” →
      Problem Statement: “Understand weekend sales trends to plan staff shifts.”

## 🎯 Tip: Start with 2–3 Hypothetical Business Goals
#### Example:

    “The owner wants to know when to hire more staff.”

    “The manager wants to stop stocking slow-selling items.”

    “The marketing team wants to promote bestsellers.”

#### 👉 Then validate these with your actual data.
